# Smart-crop-irrigation-system
Implemented a system that takes in soil moisture, environment temperature, humdity and estimates when the crop has to be watered. The parameters have been calibrated for potting mix soil.

The project is developed on STM32F407VG DISCOVERY board using the STM32CubeIDE.
In this repository, I will present the programming method for the following
- Interfacing with LCD 
- Interfacing with LM35 temperature sensor
